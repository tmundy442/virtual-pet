Virtual Pet Project
Tom Mundy

Virtual pet dog Bob has the attributes hunger, thirst, boredom and tiredness. From the console, the user is prompted to enter a number associated with an action to address the dog's needs. Each attribute starts with an initial value of 10. If the user enters '5', the tick method is invoked, and each attribute calls the method and is incremented by a random number. Any attribute that exceeds 15 generates a message to the user to address that need.

The user enters '6' to exit the program.
